# NER using RoBERTa Model

This project focuses on implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) utilizing the RoBERTa model. NER is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, and more within text.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SagarMaddela/NER-using-Roberta-Model.git
   cd NER-using-Roberta-Model
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the NER model:

1. **Prepare your dataset:**

   - Place your training and evaluation data in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data is in the correct format expected by the scripts.

2. **Configure the model parameters:**

   - Adjust the configuration settings in the `config/` directory as needed.

3. **Run the training script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will train the RoBERTa model on your dataset and evaluate its performance.
